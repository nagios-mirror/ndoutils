NDO REQUIREMENTS
----------------

Because the NDOMOD event broker module traverses internal object structures in
the Nagios daemon, it is highly sensitive to code and structure changes that
occur throughout the Nagios development process.  Therefore, it is very important
that you are using a version of the NDO utilities that matches your current
Nagios installation.

This version of the NDO utilities requires that you:

1. are either running Nagios 2.0rc2 or a later version of Nagios 2.x.

2. compiled the Nagios daemon with event broker support (enabled by default).
